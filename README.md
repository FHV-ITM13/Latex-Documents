Latex template for FHV master thesis

This latex template was especially created for writing a master thesis at University of Applied Sciences Vorarlberg (FHV).
When this template was created we tried to adapt the look and feel to the existing Microsoft Word file template.

Feel free to use it for your thesis too. You can also provide any pull requests if you like.

Feedback is welcome.

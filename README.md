## BibTeX

Please keep in mind that you have to build the document with BibTex seperatly. To get proper bibliography you have to perform the following compiling steps:

  1. LaTex
  2. BibTex
  3. LaTex
  4. LaTex

If you use any IDE take a look in the options menu - maybe you can find an option to automatize this.
